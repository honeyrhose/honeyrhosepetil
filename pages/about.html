            <p>To formally introduce myself, I am <span>Honey Rhose Petil</span>, 19 years of existence on 19th day of southern constellation the year of 2OO3. Everyone prefers to call me <span> Annie</span> or <span>Hani</span> but in our family, I was called <span>Primrose</span> or <span>Prim</span> because I am the only girl in our siblings. I know some of you are confuse, what brought me here in <span>USTP</span>? I know it's such an experience to be in here in <span>USTP</span> that everyone wouldn't dare to miss it. I took the risk to take the scholarship exam, I manage to survive and made it here somehow. Actually to get to know more about me, I am fond of reading fables, historic book, research articles, I am more on essays and whatnot but what made me think to choose IT field? I actually find myself addicted to online games especially valorant, I don't have personal laptop to play with that is why I choose this field. I have no experience nor any idea about this field but one thing I know that IT students have their own personal laptops, so please classmates bear with me. </p>

        <p><span>The 1975</span> is one of my favorite artist, I have been a lowkey fan of them since 'I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It' era. My favorite song right now is <a href="https://youtu.be/EdmpLGERRvQ"><span> 'About You' </span></a>. Hands down to their songs. I am looking forward for more.</p>

            <p><span>Taylor Swift</span> one of the most oldest artist that I stan, she's my anti-depressant, whenever a sudden wave of dreadful feeling passed me, I just listen to her songs. I have been fan of her since 'Speak Now' era, I am very fond of her songs especially <a href="https://youtu.be/ddEDXz9hRP4"><span>'If This Was A Movie'</span></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ddEDXz9hRP4"><span>'I'd Lie'</span></a>(This is her unrelease song for some reason). They say <span>Taylor Swift</span> is overrated but she's exception, she deserves the recognition she's getting right now. Patiently, waiting for 'Speak Now' (Blonde's Version), stan taylor!</p>

        <div class="bandtw">
            <p><span>TWICE</span> I already know them back then 'Sixteen' era (I'm already exposed to K-pop, influenced by BangTan Boys) When I'm Grade 6 they caught my attention, that's why I have been there fan since like 'Like Ohhh-Ahhh, I watched them grow, sadly, I don't have any updates about my girls now unlike before but I am so proud of them for where they're in now, I have life too and I want to focus on my studies more. Anyways, I love all of their tracks but while writing this I'm currently listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/x2cUrOnaCDg"><span>'Say You Love Me'</span></a> from their album 'Yes or Yes'.</p>
